Run steps

how I can run the code in Matlab?

You need to install matlab 2018a or higher. 

First: readingStep.m ----->> Reading images and feature extraction (Fractal and Pseudo Zernike moments descriptors).

Second: classificationStep.m ---->> Optimized ELM which has been improved by Shufed frog-leaping algorithm.
